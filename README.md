# WhatTheCTF
## Automated tool to find the next CTF happening!

This tool takes advantage of the API provided by https://ctftime.org/ <br>
The purpose of this tool is to quickly get to the website of the next live CTF happening. Once it finds the CTF, it will automatically open the page to the CTF in your default browser. <br>
This is great if you want to find the next CTF quickly every time!<p>

## Running the tool!
You can clone this repository with:<br>
`git clone https://github.com/Val-Resh/WhatTheCTF.git`<br>
Ensure you have JDK installed on your machine. You can download the latest version at: https://www.oracle.com/uk/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html <br>
Now, open the command prompt and change directory to path of repository you've cloned, there will be the `class` folder, ensure you're inside it in the command prompt.<br>
Now, simply run the command: <br>
`java Main`<br>
That's it! You can create a `.bat` file to simplify this if you prefer! <p>

## Updates?
For now, this tool's purpose is solely to get the next upcoming CTF. However, in the future I might consider adding other features. Either way, if there are bugs please report them to me.
